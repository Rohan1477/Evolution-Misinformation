@TheSunriseMusic @alyssamwbc  You're not allowed to claim science. Evolution is a scientific theory.  As in a hypothesis that's been proven.
@BoreanThommo @grenangle @DebunkEvolution So you accept understanding that comes through the Ev Science, yet you don't believe in Evolution.
“@Indiana_Infidel: evolution is to believe that a tornado whipped through a junkyard and made a 747.”  Skipped high school science, hey?
Science Man. What did people do before evolution? Hahahaha.
If you believe in evolution, you must believe in cannibal rats on ghost ships. That's how science works.
Ad Hominem!!! You @Prophecy_YEC personally attacked me INSTEAD of refuting my claim #evolution is 1 of the strongest theories in #science
Without religion, science wud be saying all the same things it says now; without science, religion wud still be saying Sun goes around Earth
@RichardDawkins because evolution is not  science.

You can't say you believe in Science, except where it contradicts the Bible on Evolution or Creation. You believe in Science or you don't.
@ScienceNews So cool. I think the evolution of science discoveries is some times cooler than evolution itself.
@TomBeltz Because of science, you can have knowledge of evolution. No irresponsible belief or faith is required. #atheists
People call today science what isn't science but just imagination, there's NOT a single REAL EVIDENCE for evolution or the big bang theory!
@BleeG @othellz lol...guy why are you just referencing evolution to the one in science. There are other definitions you know?
@BleeG @othellz what's the definition of evolution in the dictionary. Science can never colonize that word bro.

EVOLUTION THEORY IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD AND DECEIT EMERGED IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE IN THE HISTORY.
Evolution theory is incomplete & inaccurate.... you actually don't need rocket science to understand it isn't with new discovery.
@michaelshermer @JasonSmashTV No, more like "42% of US Christians deny evolution ergo there's a clear problem with US Xtians & science"
Don't assume because I come out of a science class that it's ok to shove your evolution crap down my throat. Cause we all know yall would
As technology advanced and as modern science unraveled the secrets of the human body people realized that evolution was a complete deception
@mhuypens Evolution isn't science. You accepted that fact because it cannot be discovered through the Empirical Method
@deisidiamonia Neither the Big Bang nor Evolution are science, since you can demonstrate neither, just philosophical beliefs, religion.
@wpcguy Nothing in the Bible or any other "holy" book strengthens or weakens Evolution. Evolution is based on science.   @cfrost1178

Evolution as hypothesis is dead and buried,and now science is free to examine the incomparable proofs in creation of God’s perfect Creation.
Evolutionist scientists know perfectly that not single branch of science's corroborated their theory and whole concept is totally groundless

@BibleSage No one ever claimed Genesis described evolution until after evolution was discovered, just like every other "science" claim.
@Cris_Paunescu science doesn't work on proof. Evolution explains the diversity of life, not the origins.
Real science can be tested and observed. Evolution has never been observed. Because it's not real. No debate will be conducted. Thank you.
@Deathsquadgr420 your right, evolution isn't science. It's a farse.
@Deathsquadgr420 @etn_atheist the only thing I'm lacking is your blind faith in evolution. Real operational science refutes evolution.
“@TheSunriseMusic: @Brainman365 ...Science destroys the "evolution" idea.” Actually, the "evolution idea" was born out of science.

@austin7175 'if' or 'could' do NOT invalidate the science. Genealogy confirms evolution alone. Your argument is nonsensical. @JaTapps
My sister can't figure out her science homework so she's just declared that evolution doesn't exist. Because that's definitely how it works.
@kaimatai  It IS obscene how so many scientists accept the big bang evolution, and abiogenesis as valid science.
@Merlady @TheoryFail @AtheistEngineer @Prophecy_YEC @FimusTauri  Evolution is not a religion it is a science grow up and get over it.
@AtheistEngineer @Prophecy_YEC @FimusTauri that's not true- I love science. But evolution is not science. It is a religion.
So Blank Slatism is not just social science that ignores human evolution, but also social science that ignores societal evolution.
@AndreDeLOurs "Evolution destroys itself, by violating the Laws of Science"  Which laws does it violate?
@Atheist_Eh @iamoneofapeople Love to waste time on evolution. Anyway, science is by definition only theory, proven to a certain level.
@hahaitsmaryyy So, what do you have against evolution then? It's established science, European Christians have no problem with it.
@realDonaldTrump @abbydNYC What science are you going to crap on tonight evolution?
@JaTapps Actually you are introducing a red herring because you know cannot demonstrate Evolution to be science. @Prophecy_YEC
If you claim the theory of evolution is "not even science" then you deserve nothing less that mockery for you are an idiot! #atheism
@Nkaton @TTDerandere  Many believers accept evolution. 'God' isn't a falsifiable claim. Specific bible claims are incompatible with science.
@ayyjay_ @TakeThatDarwin The problem you have is Evolution is science and creation has been shown not to be. Same with ID. That's your prob!

Evolutionists don't understand science. It takes more faith to believe evolution than God. I wish I had that kind of faith.
@InfernicSteve do you get this? You're wrong to think evolution is 'science', as it shows you you don't know what 'science' is and isn't.
@InfernicSteve I love science, and did the great scientists. 'Evolution' isn't science. It's an atheistic belief from those wishing God away
@pvandck @TakeThatDarwin @FimusTauri @SpaceCheef @JaTapps I tell Roman Catholics, as I once was, to reject evolution based on real science.

@MYirrell @FakeAmos43 not important whether God exists or not? Science be wrong and develop. God didn't exist before evolution theory
@JaTapps @x5xAlexanderx5x Nothing happens without reason. I'm sure Even EOS"science"will acknowledge that? What is the reason for evolution?

I think I now know how the atheist feels, when they say evolution is not a theory. It must be similar to us saying we are not anti-science.
@iconoclast500 TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE COULD BE. EVOLUTION CANNOT BE CALLED SCIENCE BUY "HONEST" SCIENCE STANDARDS IN ALL FIELDS!
As technology advanced and as modern science unraveled the secrets of the human body people realized that evolution was a complete deception
Science doesn't conflict with the Bible, but rather it's Darwinian Evolution that conflicts with both Science and the Bible.
@CarltonWhitfie8 @Prophecy_YEC desciples like you don't. I believe that science will actually derail evolution in the future. Truth

.@BibleSage Evolution isn't a religion, neither is atheism.  Evo is a branch of science, and atheism is not convinced of theistic belief.
Evolution as hypothesis is dead and buried,and now science is free to examine the incomparable proofs in creation of God’s perfect Creation.
Evolutionist scientists know perfectly that not single branch of science's corroborated their theory and whole concept is totally groundless

That's an amazing new evolution of science that's no longer science fiction, only to save human lives. The first time human hybrid.
Nobody is saying morality is "a product of science". Morality is a product of evolution, as explained by science.
and if you don't believe in evolution, you're just fucking stupid. That's the great thing about science and facts.....
evolution is not a science that can be explained, its just an idea they want everyone to except.
Evolution is a superstition from the era of Sumerians. Creation is science. We don't accept pagan superstitions against facts of science.
Evolution is anti-science, pagan superstition from time of Sumerians that attempts explaining origin of the universe through coincidences.
No new genetic information could be generated through coincidences. Genetics is a branch of science that is anti-evolutionist.

all that stuff u mentioned cannot be applied to the methods that science uses for evolution.
no. The womb and sperm made them. Science. Evolution!
nobody's seen big bang, evolution etc, men wrote all those things too. "Science" is changing even today!
Philosophy is a pseudo science at best.And should never be compared in any way to real science like the science of evolution.Which is true!
However , regarding Trump & Pence , evolution is a fallacy . It seems science gets it wrong sometimes .
If you don't believe the established science of evolution, how did humans come about?
Science holds that any number past 10 to the 50 th power is mathematical impossibility and clearly points to the impossibility of evolution
Bahaha! If science is a gift from god,why do u ignore its findings? Evolution is a tried and tested theory. You, sir, r a fraud.
Science is given to us by God, but believers in Evolution prefer not to use it. That's why no testing of Evol is allowed.
That's why evolution is science, not belief. You didn't know?

You accept any science that can fit into your belief system and reject what you can't.Did evolution not come from god by your logic?

you have to deny the basic laws of science to not "believe"in evolution, as evidenced by your rebuttals.
so you definitely don't believe in evolution then? Despite all of the science saying otherwise?
utter rot. evolutionary theory is solid science and accords with all the evidence to date

Of course I do.  I never said that.  Science is an evolutionary methodology. It's great
Saying "I don't believe in evolution" is like saying "I don't believe in science or facts".
I never even heard the word "evolution" spoken in a HS science class. They won't go near the topic.

Evolutionists have hidden the #Cambrian fossils for 70 years.They're trying to sustain a Sumerian pagan belief by hiding science from people
Usual atheist response is faith in unprovable nonsensical science. Simple; PROVE macro evolution. Oh wait, you can't?
my bio teacher explained that you don't "believe" in evolution because you don't "believe" in science. You study it.
shouldn't science be able to make a body life forever? What is evolution to you if you don't believe in Jesus Christ?
This of course the reverse of the normal crowing: science can't 'prove' macro evolution.

My favourite quote of the day: 'You don't "believe" in evolution, you either understand it or you don't.'
Seems like @jordanbpeterson doesn't understand that natural facts have no dependence to #Evolution. #Physics #STEM #CdnPoli #Gender #Science
that dichotomy often seems to stem from a lack of understanding of evolution as fact vs theory.
